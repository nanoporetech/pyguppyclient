# pyguppyclient

[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/pyguppyclient.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/pyguppyclient)

Full Python client library for communicating with `guppy_basecall_server`.

```bash
$ pip install pyguppyclient
```

## Requirements

Guppy 5.0 or later is required and the `guppy_basecall_server` must already be running.

```bash
$ guppy_basecall_server --config dna_r9.4.1_450bps_fast.cfg -p 5555 -l /tmp/guppy -x 'cuda:0'
```

## Example

The simplest usage is the `GuppyBasecallerClient` class which takes a `config` name and provides a `basecall` method that takes a read and returns a `CalledReadData` object.

```python
from pyguppyclient import GuppyBasecallerClient, yield_reads

config = "dna_r9.4.1_450bps_fast"
read_file = "reads.fast5"

with GuppyBasecallerClient(config_name=config, trace=True) as client:
    for read in yield_reads(read_file):
        called = client.basecall(read)
        print(read.read_id, called.seq[:50], called.move)
```

See the example client for the usage of the `Caller` class that uses multiprocessing to distribute the reading of `fast5` files.

```bash
$ ./examples/pyguppyclient -t 8 dna_r9.4.1_450bps_fast /data/reads > pyguppyclient.fastq
```

## Developer Quick Start

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/nanoporetech/pyguppyclient.git
$ cd pyguppy-client
$ python3 -m venv venv3
$ source ./venv3/bin/activate
(venv3) $ pip install -r requirements.txt -r development.txt
(venv3) $ python setup.py develop
(venv3) $ make test
```
